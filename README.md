# Prismatic Art

The [Prismatic Art Collection](http://prismaticart.com/) is a free library of art representing heroes of all backgrounds. In geek culture, there are plenty of Lukes, but not enough Landos or Leias. We want to change that.

This repository contains the works funded by our [Kickstarter campaign](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sarahdarkmagic/prismatic-art-collection?ref=github). All finished art is available for use under the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).
